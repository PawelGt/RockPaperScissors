# Projinda-16
Projekt till Projindan 16 - Tim Wayburn/ Philippa Ã–rnell

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game created using JavaFX. Works best with sounds!

To run the game:

1. Download the repository.
2. Compile and run the Main.java file in IDE.
3. Have fun!

We will create JUnit tests for certain methods as well as conduct user tests as soon as we have a working game.
